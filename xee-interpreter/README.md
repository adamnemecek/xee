# xee-interpreter

`xee-interpreter` provides the runtime to run Xee code. It includes a
bytecode interpreter, an implementation of XPath data types, and the XPath
standard library.

It is a low-level component, and is used by
[`xee-xpath`](https://docs.rs/xee-xpath/latest/xee_xpath/) to implement XPath
and can also serve as the engine to execute XSLT code (work in progress).
